# Event Handling with the DOM, `XMLHttpRequest` and Asynchronous Programming

## Approach

If you do not have `nodemon` installed, globally install it with `npm install -g nodemon`.

In the following exercises use everything you know about the DOM, `XMLHttpRequest` and asynchronous programming to solve the problems.

## Exercises

There are two exercises in this problem set, each of which has a corresponding directory (e.g. "Problem 1" lives in `./problem_1`) containing a `README.md` file. Read each problem separately, it may be worth only opening one problem directory in the text editor at a time.

1. [Handling Events](problem_1/README.md)
1. [Asynchronous code without promises or blocking loops](problem_2/README.md)

## Reflection

Before the end of the day take time to reflect on your work with your partner.

1. What things got you hung up?
1. What was your biggest takeaway from coding today?
1. What did you struggle the most with?
1. Were you able to help each other or did you frustrate each other? If you found yourself frustrated, what did you do to help alleviate the frustration?
